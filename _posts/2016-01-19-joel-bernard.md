**Joel Bernard**

I was born and raised in Bayside, Queens. I am naturally outgoing and have been performing since the age of ten. I love tending bar because it gives me the chance to meet new people and get to know them through my work. While traveling abroad I have sampled the drinks and cuisines of Russia, Ireland, Costa Rica, Peru and Brazil. I have worked in bars, restaurants, and have done special events for over ten years. My favorite cocktails to make are Old Fashions and Caipirinhas. 

Joel has a Master of Fine Arts degree from the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. He is a trained and certified Mixologist.

Hello! I'm Vanessa and I've been working in the hospitality and service industry for over ten years. I love using my creativity in all I do. I love to engage with people and make sure everyone is having a blast. At the end of the day, it's all about enjoying what you do. Sounds clich√© but if you are happy, others are happy and that's my philosophy in everything I do! Hope to see you soon!

Hi there! My name's Elyse, and I was born and raised in Queens, NY. I'm a super positive and outgoing person who loves putting a smile on people's faces. My two favorite things are meeting new people and Thai food (in no particular order)! What I do best is entertain and I'm no stranger to a practical joke. I figure if you can't have at least one good laugh a day, what's the point? I love working opening nights on Broadway because I actually get to meet some of the most awesome creative people in the most candid of ways. My favorite drink to mix is a white Russian (probably because I am one), but nevertheless, it makes for a heck of a conversation starter!  Na sdarovie!

I hail from San Francisco but I consider myself a true New Yorker. I'm extremely dedicated to my work and believe in the power of a good cocktail. After attending the California Culinary Academy, I moved to New York and having stopped working since. Mixology is not only a skill for me, but a passion. While I love making classic cocktails, I am always truly excited when I have the chance to put my own spin on it. Hope I get the chance to show you. Mezcal Old Fashioned? Yeeeah, Buddy!

Hi! My name is Mike and I hail from Buffalo, New York.While I do love my hometown, in my opinion there is truly nothing like the vibrancy of New York City. Besides Mixology, I am also a professional stage and television actor. There's nothing I love more than meeting new people and having a good time! Three things about a good party: I love attending them, I love throwing them and I love working them. I am whiskey man myself, and I pride myself on being as up to date on my whiskey knowledge as possible. Nothing gives me more pride than to create a great antique American whiskey based cocktail someone hasn't tried before. I hope to get a chance to make you one!

Thanks for your interest in my profile! I am kind hearted, friendly and always have a smile on at work. I love to help people, and thrive in a fast paced environment. Although my standards are high in everything I do, I like to keep things relaxed and enjoyable for everyone. I have worked for a wine importing company for over five years and am very skilled in the selection and tasting of wine. I am also well informed in regards to food allergies, nutrition, and dietary requirements, so I can be a great asset in helping clients with dietary restrictions.
