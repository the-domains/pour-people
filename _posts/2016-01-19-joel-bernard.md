I was born and raised in Bayside, Queens. I am naturally outgoing and have been performing since the age of ten. I love tending bar because it gives me the chance to meet new people and get to know them through my work. While traveling abroad I have sampled the drinks and cuisines of Russia, Ireland, Costa Rica, Peru and Brazil. I have worked in bars, restaurants, and have done special events for over ten years. My favorite cocktails to make are Old Fashions and Caipirinhas. 

Joel has a Master of Fine Arts degree from the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. He is a trained and certified Mixologist.
